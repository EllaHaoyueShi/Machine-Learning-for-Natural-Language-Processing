        "The training data preparation follows these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Reading and Tokenizing the Text: Depending on the dataset, stopwords may or may not be removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "b. Vocabulary Creation: A set of unique tokens is created, and each word is mapped to an index using a dictionary (word_to_ix).\n",
        "\n",
        "c. Generating Context-Target Pairs: For each word in the text, a context window of the specified width (e.g., 2 or 5) is used to create context-target pairs for training.\n",

        "\n",
        "Fo the initial loss, the loss started high, around 12,218.45, indicating that the model began with random initial weights. The loss decreased significantly over the epochs, dropping from 12,218.45 at epoch 0 to 21.5 at epoch 29. This steady decrease in loss suggests that the model effectively learned word representations from the given context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Training the CBOW2 model on the Hotel Reviews dataset showed that the model can learn effectively even with a smaller context window. However, the results in the next step (1.5) demonstrated that using a larger context window leads to faster convergence and a lower final loss, indicating a potential advantage for larger context sizes in word representation learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "###1.5 Train CBOW5 with a context width of 5 (in both directions) for the Hotel Reviews dataset. Are predictions made by the model sensitive towards the context size?\n",
        "Yes. From the training log plot, we can see that training loss decreases quickly using width of 5 than that of 2. And the loss of width of 2 is higher than then that of 5. Therefore, the predictions made by the model sensitive towards the context size.\n",
        "\n",
        "The initial loss was 11,826.08, slightly lower than the starting loss for the CBOW2 model. The loss decreased much faster compared to CBOW2. By epoch 5, the loss had already dropped significantly to 274.93. By epoch 29, the final loss was 7.71.\n",
        "What we can conclude from the above results is that training with a larger context window (CBOW5) led to faster convergence and lower final training loss compared to the smaller context (CBOW2) for the hotel reviews. This suggests that the model benefits from additional contextual information in learning word representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "The loss curves for both CBOW2 and CBOW5 models on the hotel reviews dataset show that the model with the larger context window reaches lower loss values more quickly, indicating better learning efficiency.\n",

        "The initial loss was 11,850.2, similar to the hotel review dataset.Then, the loss decreased steadily but not as quickly as in the hotel review dataset. By epoch 10, the loss had reduced to 250.03, and by epoch 29, the final loss was 37.72.\n",
        "Training the CBOW2 model on the Sci-Fi dataset took longer and resulted in a higher final loss compared to the hotel reviews dataset, suggesting that the narrative structure of the literary text is more complex, possibly requiring a different approach to achieve similar performance.\n",
